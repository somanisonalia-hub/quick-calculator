# Git Commit Policy

## Rule: User-Controlled Commits Only

**NEVER commit code automatically.** Only create git commits when the user explicitly requests it.

### When to Commit

✅ User explicitly says:
- "commit this"
- "git commit"
- "save changes"
- "push this"
- "create a commit"

### When NOT to Commit

❌ Do NOT commit:
- After completing a task (even if code is complete)
- After adding new features
- After fixing bugs
- After running tests
- Automatically as part of workflow
- Unless explicitly instructed by the user

### What to Do Instead

When you complete a task:

1. **Show status**: Display what changes were made
2. **Ask permission**: Say "Ready to commit? Let me know when you want me to."
3. **Wait for approval**: Only commit when user explicitly approves
4. **Report changes**: Show `git status` before and after any commit

### Example Workflow

```
❌ BAD:
User: "Add new calculator"
AI: [Adds calculator, tests it, commits automatically]
Result: Commit made without permission

✅ GOOD:
User: "Add new calculator"
AI: [Adds calculator, tests it]
AI: "✅ Debt Payoff Calculator completed. 
    - 5 files created (JSON, TSX, etc)
    - All tests passing
    - Ready for commit when you approve"
User: "commit this"
AI: [Creates git commit with message]
```

### Git Commands Allowed Without Permission

These operational commands are fine without permission:
- `git status` (checking status)
- `git log` (viewing history)
- `git diff` (viewing changes)
- `git add` (only when preparing for user-approved commit)

### Summary

**User controls commits. AI prepares and reports.**
