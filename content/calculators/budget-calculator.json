        "A student with $2,500 monthly income and $800 rent faces $1,700 deficit with current $600 food and entertainment spending. Reducing discretionary costs to $300 creates $200 surplus for savings."

        {
          "question": "How much of my income should I save each month?",
          "answer": "Aim for 20% of take-home pay as a minimum savings target, but save more if possible. The 50/30/20 rule allocates 50% to needs, 30% to wants, and 20% to savings/debt. High earners should target 25-30% savings. Build emergency funds (3-6 months expenses) first, then focus on retirement, investments, and debt reduction. Your specific percentage depends on income, expenses, and financial goals."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the best way to categorize expenses?",
          "answer": "Use these essential categories: Housing (rent/mortgage, utilities), Transportation (car, gas, insurance), Food (groceries, dining), Insurance (health, auto, home), Debt (loans, credit cards), Entertainment (movies, hobbies), and Savings. Track fixed expenses (unchanging monthly) separately from variable ones. Review bank/credit card statements to ensure nothing is missed. Use budgeting apps for automatic categorization."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I create a realistic budget I can actually follow?",
          "answer": "Start with your actual income and expenses from the past 3 months, not estimates. Use zero-based budgeting where every dollar is assigned a job. Include buffer categories for unexpected costs. Set savings goals first, then allocate remaining funds. Track spending for 30 days to identify leaks. Adjust gradually rather than making drastic cuts. Review monthly and celebrate small wins to stay motivated."
        },
        {
          "question": "Should I pay off debt or save money first?",
          "answer": "Build a $1,000 emergency fund first if you don't have one. Then follow this priority order: 1) High-interest debt (15%+ credit cards), 2) Emergency fund (3-6 months expenses), 3) Retirement accounts (401k/IRA), 4) Medium-interest debt (7-12% personal loans), 5) Low-interest debt (under 7% mortgages). Compare debt interest rates to potential savings returns. Consider debt consolidation for better rates."
        },
        {
          "question": "How often should I review and update my budget?",
          "answer": "Review weekly to catch overspending early and make mid-month adjustments. Do a full monthly review to analyze trends and plan for the next month. Update annually for inflation and life changes (new job, marriage, children). Major life events require immediate budget revisions. Use budgeting apps for real-time tracking and automatic alerts when approaching spending limits."

          "question": "¿Cuánto de mi ingreso debo ahorrar cada mes?",
          "answer": "Apunta a 20% de pago neto como meta mínima de ahorro, pero ahorra más si es posible. La regla 50/30/20 asigna 50% a necesidades, 30% a deseos, y 20% a ahorro/deuda. Ganadores altos deben apuntar a 25-30% ahorro. Construye fondos de emergencia (3-6 meses gastos) primero, luego enfócate en jubilación, inversiones, y reducción de deuda. Tu porcentaje específico depende de ingreso, gastos, y metas financieras."
        },
        {
          "question": "¿Cuál es la mejor manera de categorizar gastos?",
          "answer": "Usa estas categorías esenciales: Vivienda (renta/hipoteca, servicios), Transporte (auto, gasolina, seguro, tránsito público), Comida (abarrotes, comer fuera), Seguro (salud, auto, casa), Deuda (préstamos, tarjetas), Entretenimiento (películas, hobbies), y Ahorro. Rastrea gastos fijos (sin cambios mensuales) separadamente de variables. Revisa estados bancarios/tarjetas para asegurar que nada esté perdido. Usa apps de presupuesto para categorización automática."
        },
        {
          "question": "¿Cómo creo un presupuesto realista que realmente pueda seguir?",
          "answer": "Comienza con tu ingreso y gastos reales de los últimos 3 meses, no estimaciones. Usa presupuesto basado en cero donde cada dólar tiene un trabajo asignado. Incluye categorías buffer para costos inesperados. Establece metas de ahorro primero, luego asigna fondos restantes. Rastrea gastos por 30 días para identificar fugas. Ajusta gradualmente en lugar de hacer cortes drásticos. Revisa mensualmente y celebra pequeñas victorias para mantener motivación."

        {
          "question": "¿Debo pagar deuda o ahorrar dinero primero?",
          "answer": "Construye un fondo de emergencia de $1,000 primero si no tienes uno. Luego sigue este orden de prioridad: 1) Deuda de alto interés (15%+ tarjetas), 2) Fondo de emergencia (3-6 meses gastos), 3) Cuentas de jubilación (401k/IRA), 4) Deuda de interés medio (7-12% préstamos personales), 5) Deuda de bajo interés (bajo 7% hipotecas). Compara tasas de interés de deuda con retornos potenciales de ahorro. Considera consolidación de deuda para mejores tasas."

          "question": "¿Con qué frecuencia debo revisar y actualizar mi presupuesto?",
          "answer": "Revisa semanalmente para detectar gastos excesivos temprano y hacer ajustes de mediados de mes. Haz una revisión completa mensual para analizar tendencias y planificar el siguiente mes. Actualiza anualmente por inflación y cambios de vida (nuevo trabajo, matrimonio, hijos). Eventos mayores de vida requieren revisiones inmediatas de presupuesto. Usa apps de presupuesto para rastreo en tiempo real y alertas automáticas cuando te acerques a límites de gasto."

          "question": "Quanto de minha renda devo economizar a cada mês?",

A regra 50/30/20 aloca 50% para necessidades, 30% para desejos, e 20% para economia/dívida. Ganhadores altos devem mirar 25-30% economia. Construa fundos de emergência (3-6 meses despesas) primeiro, então foque em aposentadoria, investimentos, e redução de dívida. Sua porcentagem específica depende de renda, despesas, e metas financeiras."

          "question": "Qual é a melhor maneira de categorizar despesas?",
          "answer": "Use estas categorias essenciais: Moradia (aluguel/hipoteca, utilitários), Transporte (carro, gasolina, seguro, transporte público), Comida (mantimentos, comer fora), Seguro (saúde, auto, casa), Dívida (empréstimos, cartões), Entretenimento (filmes, hobbies), e Economia. Rastreie despesas fixas (sem mudança mensal) separadamente de variáveis. Revise extratos bancários/cartões para garantir que nada esteja perdido. Use apps de orçamento para categorização automática."
        },
        {
          "question": "Como criar um orçamento realista que eu possa realmente seguir?",
          "answer": "Comece com sua renda e despesas reais dos últimos 3 meses, não estimativas. Use orçamento baseado em zero onde cada dólar tem um trabalho atribuído. Inclua categorias buffer para custos inesperados. Defina metas de economia primeiro, então aloque fundos restantes. Rastreie gastos por 30 dias para identificar vazamentos. Ajuste gradualmente ao invés de fazer cortes drásticos. Revise mensalmente e celebre pequenas vitórias para manter motivação."

        {
          "question": "Devo pagar dívidas ou economizar dinheiro primeiro?",
          "answer": "Construa um fundo de emergência de $1,000 primeiro se você não tiver um. Então siga esta ordem de prioridade: 1) Dívida de alto juros (15%+ cartões), 2) Fundo de emergência (3-6 meses despesas), 3) Contas de aposentadoria (401k/IRA), 4) Dívida de juros médios (7-12% empréstimos pessoais), 5) Dívida de baixo juros (abaixo 7% hipotecas). Compare taxas de juros de dívida com retornos potenciais de economia. Considere consolidação de dívida para melhores taxas."

          "question": "Com que frequência devo revisar e atualizar meu orçamento?",
          "answer": "Revise semanalmente para pegar gastos excessivos cedo e fazer ajustes de meio mês. Faça uma revisão completa mensal para analisar tendências e planejar o próximo mês. Atualize anualmente por inflação e mudanças de vida (novo trabalho, casamento, filhos). Eventos maiores de vida requerem revisões imediatas de orçamento. Use apps de orçamento para rastreamento em tempo real e alertas automáticos quando se aproximar de limites de gasto."

      "formulaExplanation": "La calculatrice de budget suit les principes fondamentaux de finances personnelles : Revenu Total - Dépenses Totales = Solde Budgétaire. Si solde est positif, vous avez surplus pour épargne. Si négatif, vous dépensez trop. La règle 50/30/20 suggère d'allouer 50% aux besoins (logement, nourriture, transport), 30% aux envies (divertissement, restauration), et 20% à l'épargne/dette. Les scores de santé financière considèrent taux d'épargne, ratio dette-revenu, et contrôle des dépenses. Fonds d'urgence doivent égaler 3-6 mois de dépenses pour vraie sécurité financière.",

          "question": "Combien de mon revenu devrais-je épargner chaque mois ?",
          "answer": "Visez 20% de salaire net comme cible minimum d'épargne, mais épargnez plus si possible. La règle 50/30/20 alloue 50% aux besoins, 30% aux envies, et 20% à l'épargne/dette. Gagneurs élevés devraient cibler 25-30% épargne. Construisez fonds d'urgence (3-6 mois dépenses) d'abord, puis concentrez-vous sur retraite, investissements, et réduction de dette. Votre pourcentage spécifique dépend de revenu, dépenses, et objectifs financiers."

          "question": "Quelle est la meilleure façon de catégoriser les dépenses ?",
          "answer": "Utilisez ces catégories essentielles : Logement (loyer/prêt, services), Transport (auto, essence, assurance, transports en commun), Nourriture (épicerie, restauration), Assurance (santé, auto, habitation), Dette (prêts, cartes), Divertissement (films, loisirs), et Épargne. Suivez dépenses fixes (inchangées mensuellement) séparément des variables. Examinez relevés bancaires/cartes pour vous assurer que rien n'est manqué. Utilisez apps budgétaires pour catégorisation automatique."

        {
          "question": "Comment créer un budget réaliste que je peux réellement suivre ?",
          "answer": "Commencez avec votre revenu et dépenses réels des 3 derniers mois, pas estimations. Utilisez budgétisation zéro où chaque dollar a un travail assigné. Incluez catégories tampon pour coûts inattendus. Définissez objectifs d'épargne d'abord, puis allouez fonds restants. Suivez dépenses pendant 30 jours pour identifier fuites. Ajustez progressivement plutôt que faire coupes drastiques. Examinez mensuellement et célébrez petites victoires pour rester motivé."

        {
          "question": "Dois-je rembourser dettes ou épargner de l'argent d'abord ?",
          "answer": "Construisez fonds d'urgence de 1 000 $ d'abord si vous n'en avez pas. Puis suivez cet ordre de priorité : 1) Dette haut intérêt (15%+ cartes), 2) Fonds d'urgence (3-6 mois dépenses), 3) Comptes retraite (401k/IRA), 4) Dette intérêt moyen (7-12% prêts personnels), 5) Dette faible intérêt (sous 7% hypothèques). Comparez taux d'intérêt dette à rendements épargne potentiels. Considérez consolidation dette pour meilleurs taux."

          "question": "À quelle fréquence dois-je examiner et mettre à jour mon budget ?",
          "answer": "Examinez hebdomadairement pour attraper dépenses excessives tôt et faire ajustements milieu-mois. Faites examen complet mensuel pour analyser tendances et planifier mois suivant. Mettez à jour annuellement pour inflation et changements de vie (nouvel emploi, mariage, enfants). Événements majeurs de vie nécessitent révisions budgétaires immédiates. Utilisez apps budgétaires pour suivi temps réel et alertes automatiques quand approchant limites de dépenses."
