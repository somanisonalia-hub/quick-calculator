          "question": "How do I calculate concrete volume for a slab?",
          "answer": "Multiply length × width × thickness (all in feet) to get cubic feet, then divide by 27 for cubic yards. For a 20×30 foot driveway with 4-inch thickness: 20 × 30 × 0.33 = 198 cubic feet ÷ 27 = 7.33 cubic yards. Add 5-10% waste factor for cuts and spillage. This gives you the ready-mix amount or helps calculate bag quantities (each 80lb bag yields about 0.6 cubic feet of concrete)."
        },
        {
          "question": "How many bags of concrete do I need?",
          "answer": "Divide total cubic feet by bag yield (0.45-0.6 cubic feet per 60-80lb bag). For 198 cubic feet from above: 198 ÷ 0.6 = 330 bags (80lb bags) or 198 ÷ 0.45 = 440 bags (60lb bags). Always add waste factor and buy extra. Bag sizes vary: 60lb bags yield ~0.45 cubic feet, 80lb bags yield ~0.6 cubic feet. Mix entire bags at once to avoid waste."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the difference between ready-mix and bagged concrete?",
          "answer": "Ready-mix is delivered in trucks (minimum 1-2 cubic yards) and mixed on-site for consistent quality. Bagged concrete is pre-mixed dry material you mix with water yourself. Ready-mix costs more but saves labor and ensures proper mixing. Bagged concrete is cheaper for small projects but requires mixing equipment and physical labor. Ready-mix is better for large projects, bagged for small repairs or when delivery is difficult."
        },
        {
          "question": "How much does concrete cost per cubic yard?",
          "answer": "Ready-mix costs $100-150 per cubic yard depending on location and strength. Bagged concrete costs $4-6 per 80lb bag ($133-200 per cubic yard equivalent). Delivery adds $50-100 per load. Total costs include forms ($1-3 per square foot), rebar ($0.50-1 per square foot), and finishing. Factor in waste (5-10%) and never order exactly - concrete is cheaper than delays or additional deliveries."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do I need to account for waste when calculating concrete?",
          "answer": "Always add 5-10% waste factor for spillage, uneven forms, cuts, and imperfect mixing. For complex projects with many corners or irregular shapes, add 10-15%. Over-ordering is cheaper than under-ordering - concrete is inexpensive compared to labor delays. Keep extra concrete for small repairs or future projects. Ready-mix suppliers often provide waste estimates based on project complexity."

Para entrada de autos de 20×30 pies con espesor de 4 pulgadas: 20 × 30 × 0.33 = 198 pies cúbicos ÷ 27 = 7.33 yardas cúbicas. Agrega factor de desperdicio de 5-10% para cortes y derrames.

Para 198 pies cúbicos de arriba: 198 ÷ 0.6 = 330 sacos (sacos de 80lb) o 198 ÷ 0.45 = 440 sacos (sacos de 60lb). Siempre agrega factor de desperdicio y compra extra.

          "answer": "Concreto premezclado se entrega en camiones (mínimo 1-2 yardas cúbicas) y se mezcla en sitio para calidad consistente. Concreto en sacos es material seco premezclado que mezclas con agua tú mismo. Concreto premezclado cuesta más pero ahorra trabajo y asegura mezcla apropiada. Concreto en sacos es más barato para proyectos pequeños pero requiere equipo de mezcla y trabajo físico. Concreto premezclado es mejor para proyectos grandes, en sacos para reparaciones pequeñas o cuando entrega es difícil."

          "question": "¿Cuánto cuesta el concreto por yarda cúbica?",
          "answer": "Concreto premezclado cuesta $100-150 por yarda cúbica dependiendo de ubicación y resistencia. Concreto en sacos cuesta $4-6 por saco de 80lb ($133-200 por yarda cúbica equivalente). Entrega agrega $50-100 por carga. Costos totales incluyen formas ($1-3 por pie cuadrado), refuerzo ($0.50-1 por pie cuadrado), y terminación.

          "answer": "Siempre agrega factor de desperdicio de 5-10% para derrames, formas irregulares, cortes, y mezcla imperfecta. Para proyectos complejos con muchas esquinas o formas irregulares, agrega 10-15%. Ordenar de más es más barato que ordenar de menos - concreto es barato comparado con demoras de trabajo. Mantén concreto extra para reparaciones pequeñas o proyectos futuros. Proveedores de premezclado a menudo proporcionan estimaciones de desperdicio basado en complejidad del proyecto."

Para 198 pés cúbicos de cima: 198 ÷ 0.6 = 330 sacos (sacos de 80lb) ou 198 ÷ 0.45 = 440 sacos (sacos de 60lb). Sempre adicione fator de desperdício e compre extra. Tamanhos de saco variam: sacos de 60lb produzem ~0.45 pés cúbicos, sacos de 80lb produzem ~0.6 pés cúbicos. Misture sacos inteiros de uma vez para evitar desperdício."
        },
        {
          "question": "Qual é diferença entre concreto pronto e em sacos?",
          "answer": "Concreto pronto é entregue em caminhões (mínimo 1-2 jardas cúbicas) e misturado no local para qualidade consistente. Concreto em sacos é material seco pré-misturado que você mistura com água você mesmo. Concreto pronto custa mais mas economiza trabalho e garante mistura apropriada. Concreto em sacos é mais barato para projetos pequenos mas requer equipamento de mistura e trabalho físico. Concreto pronto é melhor para projetos grandes, em sacos para reparos pequenos ou quando entrega é difícil."
        },
        {
          "question": "Quanto custa concreto por jarda cúbica?",
          "answer": "Concreto pronto custa $100-150 por jarda cúbica dependendo de localização e resistência. Concreto em sacos custa $4-6 por saco de 80lb ($133-200 por jarda cúbica equivalente). Entrega adiciona $50-100 por carga. Custos totais incluem formas ($1-3 por pé quadrado), reforço ($0.50-1 por pé quadrado), e acabamento. Considere desperdício (5-10%) e nunca ordene exatamente - concreto é mais barato que atrasos ou entregas adicionais."
        },
        {
          "question": "Eu preciso considerar desperdício ao calcular concreto?",
          "answer": "Sempre adicione fator de desperdício de 5-10% para derramamentos, formas irregulares, cortes, e mistura imperfeita. Para projetos complexos com muitas esquinas ou formas irregulares, adicione 10-15%. Super-ordenar é mais barato que sub-ordenar - concreto é barato comparado a atrasos de trabalho. Mantenha concreto extra para reparos pequenos ou projetos futuros. Fornecedores de pronto frequentemente fornecem estimativas de desperdício baseado em complexidade do projeto."

          "question": "Comment calculer volume béton pour une dalle ?",
          "answer": "Multipliez longueur × largeur × épaisseur (tout en pieds) pour obtenir pieds cubes, puis divisez par 27 pour verges cubes. Pour entrée 20×30 pieds avec épaisseur 4 pouces : 20 × 30 × 0.33 = 198 pieds cubes ÷ 27 = 7.33 verges cubes. Ajoutez facteur gaspillage 5-10% pour coupes et déversements. Cela vous donne quantité prêt ou aide calculer quantités sacs (chaque sac 80lb produit environ 0.6 pieds cubes de béton)."
        },
        {
          "question": "Combien sacs de béton ai-je besoin ?",
          "answer": "Divisez pieds cubes totaux par rendement sac (0.45-0.6 pieds cubes par sac 60-80lb). Pour 198 pieds cubes d'en haut : 198 ÷ 0.6 = 330 sacs (sacs 80lb) ou 198 ÷ 0.45 = 440 sacs (sacs 60lb). Ajoutez toujours facteur gaspillage et achetez extra. Tailles sac varient : sacs 60lb produisent ~0.45 pieds cubes, sacs 80lb produisent ~0.6 pieds cubes. Mélangez sacs entiers à la fois pour éviter gaspillage."

          "question": "Quelle est différence entre béton prêt et en sacs ?",
          "answer": "Béton prêt est livré en camions (minimum 1-2 verges cubes) et mélangé sur site pour qualité consistante. Béton en sacs est matériau sec pré-mélangé vous mélangez avec eau vous-même. Béton prêt coûte plus mais économise travail et assure mélange approprié. Béton en sacs est moins cher pour projets petits mais nécessite équipement mélange et travail physique. Béton prêt est meilleur pour projets grands, en sacs pour réparations petites ou quand livraison est difficile."
        },
        {
          "question": "Combien coûte béton par verge cube ?",
          "answer": "Béton prêt coûte $100-150 par verge cube selon localisation et résistance. Béton en sacs coûte $4-6 par sac 80lb ($133-200 par verge cube équivalent). Livraison ajoute $50-100 par chargement. Coûts totaux incluent coffrages ($1-3 par pied carré), armature ($0.50-1 par pied carré), et finition. Facteur gaspillage (5-10%) et ne commandez jamais exactement - béton est moins cher que délais ou livraisons supplémentaires."
        },
        {
          "question": "Dois-je tenir compte gaspillage en calculant béton ?",
          "answer": "Ajoutez toujours facteur gaspillage 5-10% pour déversements, coffrages irréguliers, coupes, et mélange imparfait. Pour projets complexes avec beaucoup coins ou formes irrégulières, ajoutez 10-15%. Sur-commander est moins cher que sous-commander - béton est bon marché comparé à délais travail. Gardez béton extra pour réparations petites ou projets futurs. Fournisseurs prêt fournissent souvent estimations gaspillage basé sur complexité projet."
