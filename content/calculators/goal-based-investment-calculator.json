    ],
    "formulaExplanation": "Goal-based calculation works backwards using the Future Value formula. The calculator determines: Required SIP = FV target × [r / ((1 + r)^n - 1)], or Required Lumpsum = FV target / (1 + r)^n. The inflation-adjusted goal means you're planning for what the amount will actually be worth when you need it, not today's value. This ensures your goal amount remains realistic across inflation.",
