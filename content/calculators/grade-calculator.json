Your current grade is calculated by multiplying each assignment score by its weight, summing these values, and dividing by the total weight of completed assignments.

This formula accounts for the proportional contribution of each component to your final grade.",

It's particularly useful during midterms and finals when students need to know exactly what scores they need to achieve their target grades.",
