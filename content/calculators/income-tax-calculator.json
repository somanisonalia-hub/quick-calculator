      "formulaExplanation": "Income tax calculation follows IRS procedures: First, calculate adjusted gross income (AGI) from gross income. Then subtract either the standard deduction or itemized deductions, plus personal exemptions for dependents. The resulting taxable income is taxed using progressive tax brackets where each portion of income is taxed at different rates. State income tax is calculated separately using state-specific rates. Tax credits are subtracted directly from the total tax liability. The effective tax rate is total tax divided by gross income, while the marginal tax rate is the rate applied to the last dollar earned.",
      "examples": [
        "A single filer in California earning $75,000 with standard deduction would have taxable income of $61,550, federal tax of $8,525, state tax of $1,725, and total tax liability of $10,250 (13.7% effective rate, 22% marginal rate)",
        "A married couple filing jointly in Texas earning $120,000 with $25,000 itemized deductions and $4,000 tax credits would have taxable income of $92,600, federal tax of $13,200 (after credits), $0 state tax, and total tax liability of $13,200 (11.0% effective rate, 22% marginal rate)"

      "importantNotes": "This calculator provides estimates based on 2026 tax brackets, standard deductions ($15,000 for single filers, $30,000 for married filing jointly), and general state tax rates. Actual taxes may vary based on additional income sources, specific deductions, credits eligibility, local tax laws, and IRS rules.

      "faqs": [
        {
          "question": "What's the difference between marginal tax rate and effective tax rate?",
          "answer": "Your marginal tax rate is the tax rate applied to your last dollar of income - the highest tax bracket you fall into. Your effective tax rate is your total tax liability divided by your total income - the average rate you pay on all your income. Most taxpayers have an effective rate lower than their marginal rate."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is taxable income?",
          "answer": "Taxable income is your adjusted gross income (AGI) minus deductions and exemptions. AGI includes wages, salaries, tips, and other income sources minus certain adjustments. Deductions can be the standard amount or itemized expenses like mortgage interest, state taxes paid, and charitable donations. Exemptions are amounts subtracted for each dependent and yourself."
        },
        {
          "question": "What tax credits are available?",
          "answer": "Common tax credits include the Child Tax Credit (up to $2,000 per qualifying child), Child and Dependent Care Credit, Education Credits (American Opportunity and Lifetime Learning), Adoption Credit, Electric Vehicle Credit, and energy efficiency credits. Credits reduce your tax liability dollar-for-dollar, unlike deductions which reduce your taxable income."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I choose between standard and itemized deductions?",
          "answer": "Compare the standard deduction amount to your itemized deductions total. Use whichever gives you the greater deduction. The standard deduction is simpler but itemizing can be beneficial if you have significant mortgage interest, state taxes paid, charitable donations, or medical expenses exceeding 7.5% of AGI. Most taxpayers use the standard deduction."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why do states have different tax rates?",
          "answer": "Nine states have no state income tax (Texas, Florida, Nevada, Washington, Wyoming, South Dakota, Alaska, Tennessee, New Hampshire). Other states have progressive tax systems with rates typically ranging from 3% to 13.3%, depending on income level and state-specific tax structures. Some states also tax different types of income differently."
        },
        {
          "question": "What income is subject to federal income tax?",
          "answer": "Almost all income is subject to federal income tax including wages, salaries, tips, bonuses, self-employment income, interest, dividends, capital gains, rental income, and retirement distributions. Some income may be tax-exempt such as certain Social Security benefits, municipal bond interest, and gifts under $19,000 annually (2026 limit)."
        },
        {
          "question": "How often do tax brackets change?",
          "answer": "Tax brackets are indexed for inflation and typically adjusted annually. Major tax law changes can also affect brackets, deductions, and credits. Tax rates and deductions are regularly updated to reflect current tax law and inflation adjustments."

Luego resta deducción estándar o deducciones detalladas, más exenciones personales por dependientes. El ingreso gravable resultante se grava usando categorías progresivas donde cada porción de ingreso se grava a diferentes tasas. El impuesto estatal a la renta se calcula separadamente usando tasas específicas del estado. Los créditos fiscales se restan directamente de la responsabilidad fiscal total. La tasa efectiva de impuesto es impuesto total dividido por ingreso bruto, mientras la tasa marginal es la tasa aplicada al último dólar ganado.",

        "Una pareja casada declarando conjuntamente en Texas ganando $120,000 con $25,000 deducciones detalladas y $4,000 créditos fiscales tendría ingreso gravable de $92,600, impuesto federal de $13,200 (después créditos), $0 impuesto estatal, y responsabilidad fiscal total de $13,200 (11.0% tasa efectiva, 22% tasa marginal)"

        {
          "question": "What's the difference between marginal tax rate and effective tax rate?",
          "answer": "Your marginal tax rate is the tax rate applied to your last dollar of income - the highest tax bracket you fall into. Your effective tax rate is your total tax liability divided by your total income - the average rate you pay on all your income. Most taxpayers have an effective rate lower than their marginal rate."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is taxable income?",
          "answer": "Taxable income is your adjusted gross income (AGI) minus deductions and exemptions. AGI includes wages, salaries, tips, and other income sources minus certain adjustments. Deductions can be the standard amount or itemized expenses like mortgage interest, state taxes paid, and charitable donations. Exemptions are amounts subtracted for each dependent and yourself."
        },
        {
          "question": "What tax credits are available?",
          "answer": "Common tax credits include the Child Tax Credit (up to $2,000 per qualifying child), Child and Dependent Care Credit, Education Credits (American Opportunity and Lifetime Learning), Adoption Credit, Electric Vehicle Credit, and energy efficiency credits. Credits reduce your tax liability dollar-for-dollar, unlike deductions which reduce your taxable income."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I choose between standard and itemized deductions?",
          "answer": "Compare the standard deduction amount to your itemized deductions total. Use whichever gives you the greater deduction. The standard deduction is simpler but itemizing can be beneficial if you have significant mortgage interest, state taxes paid, charitable donations, or medical expenses exceeding 7.5% of AGI. Most taxpayers use the standard deduction."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why do states have different tax rates?",
          "answer": "Nine states have no state income tax (Texas, Florida, Nevada, Washington, Wyoming, South Dakota, Alaska, Tennessee, New Hampshire). Other states have progressive tax systems with rates typically ranging from 3% to 13.3%, depending on income level and state-specific tax structures. Some states also tax different types of income differently."
        },
        {
          "question": "What income is subject to federal income tax?",
          "answer": "Almost all income is subject to federal income tax including wages, salaries, tips, bonuses, self-employment income, interest, dividends, capital gains, rental income, and retirement distributions. Some income may be tax-exempt such as certain Social Security benefits, municipal bond interest, and gifts under $19,000 annually (2026 limit)."
        },
        {
          "question": "How often do tax brackets change?",
          "answer": "Tax brackets are indexed for inflation and typically adjusted annually. Major tax law changes can also affect brackets, deductions, and credits. Tax rates and deductions are regularly updated to reflect current tax law and inflation adjustments."

          "answer": "Your marginal tax rate is the tax rate applied to your last dollar of income - the highest tax bracket you fall into. Your effective tax rate is your total tax liability divided by your total income - the average rate you pay on all your income. Most taxpayers have an effective rate lower than their marginal rate."

        {
          "question": "What is taxable income?",
          "answer": "Taxable income is your adjusted gross income (AGI) minus deductions and exemptions. AGI includes wages, salaries, tips, and other income sources minus certain adjustments. Deductions can be the standard amount or itemized expenses like mortgage interest, state taxes paid, and charitable donations. Exemptions are amounts subtracted for each dependent and yourself."

          "answer": "Common tax credits include the Child Tax Credit (up to $2,000 per qualifying child), Child and Dependent Care Credit, Education Credits (American Opportunity and Lifetime Learning), Adoption Credit, Electric Vehicle Credit, and energy efficiency credits. Credits reduce your tax liability dollar-for-dollar, unlike deductions which reduce your taxable income."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I choose between standard and itemized deductions?",
          "answer": "Compare the standard deduction amount to your itemized deductions total. Use whichever gives you the greater deduction. The standard deduction is simpler but itemizing can be beneficial if you have significant mortgage interest, state taxes paid, charitable donations, or medical expenses exceeding 7.5% of AGI. Most taxpayers use the standard deduction."
