        "Compare with lumpsum invested at different dates"
      ],
      "formulaExplanation": "Lumpsum uses compound interest formula: FV = PV × (1 + r)^n. Your initial amount multiplies by (1 + rate) for each year. Example: ₹10 lakh at 12% for 10 years = ₹31 lakh. The longer you stay invested, exponential growth creates wealth multiplication with minimal additional effort.",

      "importantNotes": "Lumpsum is riskier than SIP in volatile markets (you invest at one point). Best invested during market corrections. Stagger large sums into 3-4 installments to reduce timing risk. Tax implications: investments held >1 year get long-term capital gains tax treatment in India (20% with indexation benefit).",

        {
          "question": "Should I invest entire amount at once or stagger it?",
          "answer": "For ₹10 lakh+, consider Systematic Transfer Plan (STP) - invest in debt fund, then automatically move to equity monthly. This reduces timing risk. Smaller amounts can be invested lumpsum as market timing is nearly impossible."
        },
        {
          "question": "What if market crashes after I invest lumpsum?",
          "answer": "Stay invested. Market crashes are temporary; long-term equity returns always recover. Panic selling locks in losses. Investors who invested before 2008 crash recovered + profited by 2013. Time beats timing."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is lumpsum or SIP better for ₹5 lakh?",
          "answer": "₹5 lakh in equity lumpsum: ~₹18.5 lakh in 10 years (at 12%). ₹5,000 SIP for 10 years: ~₹9.2 lakh. Lumpsum wins if invested at right time, but SIP is safer psychologically and statistically (reduces timing risk)."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is indexation benefit for capital gains?",
          "answer": "In India, investments held >1 year get indexation - cost base adjusted for inflation. Example: ₹10 lakh invested in 2014, sold for ₹20 lakh in 2024. After indexation, taxable gain ≈₹8-10 lakh instead of full ₹10 lakh. Saves 20% tax."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I withdraw lumpsum investment anytime?",
          "answer": "Yes, but check exit load and tax implications. <1 year: 1% exit load + short-term tax. >1 year: free exit + long-term tax benefit (20% with indexation). Best to lock in 3+ years for meaningful wealth creation."
