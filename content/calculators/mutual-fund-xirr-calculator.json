    "summary": "Calculate XIRR returns on mutual fund investments accounting for transaction timing",
    "introduction": "XIRR (Extended Internal Rate of Return) is the most accurate way to measure your investment returns when you have irregular transactions or multiple SIP entries. Unlike simple CAGR, XIRR accounts for the timing of each transaction, giving you the true rate of return. Our calculator helps you understand your actual investment performance and compare it against benchmarks.",
    "benefits": [
      "Calculates accurate time-weighted returns using XIRR method",
      "Handles multiple irregular transactions and SIP entries",
      "Accounts for timing of investments and withdrawals",
      "Shows actual performance vs expected returns",
      "Perfect for comparing different mutual funds",

    "steps": [
      "Enter your investment amounts and transaction dates (all SIP entries)",

    ],
    "inputsExplained": [
      "Transaction Date: The exact date of investment, SIP entry, or redemption",
      "Transaction Amount: Investment amount (positive) or redemption/current value (negative for exit)",
      "Net Investment: Sum of all amounts invested over time",
      "Current Value: Current portfolio value (or final redemption amount if scheme sold)"
    ],
    "formulaExplanation": "XIRR uses the Internal Rate of Return formula with daily compounding. It solves: NPV = 0 = Σ [Cash Flow / (1 + XIRR)^(days/365)]. Each transaction is weighted by how long money remained invested. This method is superior to CAGR when you have timing variations in investments - it gives you the actual annualized return your money earned regardless of when you invested.",

      "formulaExplanation": "XIRR uses Internal Rate of Return formula accounting for cash flows at different times. It finds the rate that makes NPV (Net Present Value) of all cash flows = 0. Example: Invested ₹10,000 in Jan 2020, ₹10,000 in Jan 2021, current value ₹25,000 in 2024 = 30% XIRR. Better than simple return (25,000-20,000)/20,000 = 25%) because it accounts for timing.",
      "examples": [
        "SIP ₹5,000/month for 5 years (total ₹3 lakh), current value ₹4 lakh = ~15-18% XIRR",
        "Lumpsum ₹10 lakh in Jan 2020, current value ₹18 lakh in 2024 = ~16% XIRR",
        "Multiple investments: ₹5 lakh (2020), ₹8 lakh (2021), withdrawn ₹2 lakh (2022), current ₹15 lakh = XIRR calculation accounts for all timings"
      ],
      "whoShouldUse": "SIP investors tracking portfolio performance, mutual fund investors with multiple transactions, those comparing fund performance against benchmarks, individuals evaluating advisor performance, anyone wanting to understand true investment returns vs simple percentage gains.",
      "importantNotes": "XIRR is superior to CAGR for measuring actual investment performance. Benchmark comparison: Equity funds typically return 10-15% XIRR, Balanced: 8-12%, Debt: 6-8%. Consider expense ratio (1-2% annually) when interpreting XIRR vs benchmark. Tax impact: XIRR shown as pre-tax; actual returns after 20% TCS/capital gains tax will be lower.",

        {
          "question": "What's the difference between XIRR and CAGR?",
          "answer": "CAGR is simple annualized return. XIRR accounts for when each investment was made. SIP ₹5,000/month for 5 years: CAGR ignores timing (wrong), XIRR accounts for it (correct). Use XIRR for actual fund performance."
        },
        {
          "question": "Should I switch funds if XIRR is below 12%?",
          "answer": "Not immediately. Consider: underperformance might be short-term (1-2 years). Check 3-5 year XIRR vs benchmark. High exit loads reduce returns. Switching incurs taxes. Review fund strategy before exiting."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is 15% XIRR good?",
          "answer": "Very good! Equity funds average 10-12% long-term. 15% beats most advisors/funds. Debt funds at 7-8% are good. Mixed above benchmark by 2-3% = good performance."
        },
        {
          "question": "How often should I check XIRR?",
          "answer": "Quarterly check is fine (don't obsess). Annual review recommended. During market crashes, checking daily is counter-productive. Focus on 3-5 year XIRR, not quarterly volatility."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can XIRR be negative?",
          "answer": "Yes, if current value < total invested. Market correction can cause negative XIRR short-term. Stay invested - historically all corrections reverse. Panic selling locks in losses."
