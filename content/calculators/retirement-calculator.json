        {
          "question": "How much do I need to save for retirement?",
          "answer": "Most financial experts recommend saving 15-20 times your pre-retirement annual income. For a $60,000 salary, you'd need $900,000-$1.2 million. This provides 4% annual withdrawal ($3,000-$4,800 monthly) plus Social Security. Use our calculator to determine your specific target based on desired retirement income and expected returns."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the best age to start saving for retirement?",
          "answer": "The earlier, the better. Starting at age 25 with $300 monthly at 7% returns accumulates $1.2 million by age 65. Waiting until age 35 reduces this to $680,000 - losing over $500,000. Even small amounts early provide compound interest time to work, making retirement goals much more achievable."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I know what withdrawal rate is safe in retirement?",
          "answer": "The 4% rule suggests withdrawing 4% annually (plus inflation adjustments) from retirement savings. For $500,000 saved, this provides $20,000 yearly initially. This rate historically sustained 30+ year retirements through market fluctuations. Conservative investors use 3%, aggressive investors might use 5%, but personal risk tolerance and life expectancy matter."
        },
        {
          "question": "Should I max out my 401k or pay off debt first?",
          "answer": "Compare interest rates: if mortgage is 4% but 401k earns 7% pre-tax, investing wins. But if credit card debt costs 18%, pay that first. Generally, prioritize emergency fund, then high-interest debt, then max tax-advantaged retirement accounts. Use the calculator to see how different contribution levels affect your retirement security."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does Social Security factor into retirement planning?",
          "answer": "Social Security replaces about 40% of pre-retirement income for average earners, but less for high earners. Full benefits start at age 67, with reduced benefits from age 62. Delaying benefits to age 70 increases payments by 8% annually. Include estimated benefits in planning, but don't rely solely on them - plan as if they'll be 20-30% lower than promised."

          "answer": "La regla del 4% sugiere retirar 4% anualmente (más ajustes por inflación) de ahorros de jubilación. Para $500,000 ahorrados, esto proporciona $20,000 anualmente inicialmente. Esta tasa históricamente sostuvo jubilaciones de 30+ años a través de fluctuaciones de mercado. Inversores conservadores usan 3%, inversores agresivos podrían usar 5%, pero tolerancia personal al riesgo y esperanza de vida importan."

          "question": "¿Debo maximizar mi 401k o pagar deuda primero?",

Generalmente, prioriza fondo de emergencias, luego deuda de alto interés, luego maximiza cuentas de jubilación con ventajas fiscales. Usa la calculadora para ver cómo diferentes niveles de contribución afectan tu seguridad de jubilación."

Beneficios completos comienzan a los 67 años, con beneficios reducidos desde los 62 años. Retrasando beneficios hasta los 70 años aumenta pagos en 8% anualmente. Incluye beneficios estimados en planificación, pero no confíes únicamente en ellos - planea como si fueran 20-30% menores que prometidos."

          "question": "Quanto preciso economizar para aposentadoria?",
          "answer": "A maioria dos especialistas financeiros recomenda economizar 15-20 vezes sua renda anual pré-aposentadoria. Para um salário de $60,000, você precisaria $900,000-$1.2 milhão. Isso fornece retirada anual de 4% ($3,000-$4,800 mensais) mais Previdência Social. Use nossa calculadora para determinar seu alvo específico baseado em renda desejada de aposentadoria e retornos esperados."
        },
        {
          "question": "Qual é a melhor idade para começar a economizar para aposentadoria?",
          "answer": "Quanto antes, melhor. Começando aos 25 anos com $300 mensais a retornos de 7% acumula $1.2 milhão aos 65 anos. Esperando até os 35 anos reduz isso para $680,000 - perdendo mais de $500,000. Mesmo valores pequenos cedo fornecem tempo de juros compostos para trabalhar, tornando metas de aposentadoria muito mais alcançáveis."
        },
        {
          "question": "Como sei qual taxa de retirada é segura na aposentadoria?",
          "answer": "A regra dos 4% sugere retirar 4% anualmente (mais ajustes por inflação) de economias de aposentadoria. Para $500,000 economizados, isso fornece $20,000 anualmente inicialmente. Esta taxa historicamente sustentou aposentadorias de 30+ anos através de flutuações de mercado. Investidores conservadores usam 3%, investidores agressivos podem usar 5%, mas tolerância pessoal ao risco e expectativa de vida importam."
        },
        {
          "question": "Devo maximizar meu 401k ou pagar dívidas primeiro?",
          "answer": "Compare taxas de juros: se hipoteca é 4% mas 401k ganha 7% pré-impostos, investir vence. Mas se dívida de cartão de crédito custa 18%, pague isso primeiro. Geralmente, priorize fundo de emergência, então dívidas de alto juros, então maximize contas de aposentadoria com vantagens fiscais. Use a calculadora para ver como diferentes níveis de contribuição afetam sua segurança de aposentadoria."
        },
        {
          "question": "Como a Previdência Social se encaixa no planejamento de aposentadoria?",
          "answer": "A Previdência Social substitui cerca de 40% da renda pré-aposentadoria para ganhadores médios, mas menos para ganhadores altos. Benefícios completos começam aos 67 anos, com benefícios reduzidos a partir dos 62 anos. Adiando benefícios até os 70 anos aumenta pagamentos em 8% anualmente. Inclua benefícios estimados no planejamento, mas não confie apenas neles - planeje como se fossem 20-30% menores que prometidos."
