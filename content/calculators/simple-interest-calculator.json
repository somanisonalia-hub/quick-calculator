This straightforward calculation means interest is earned only on the original principal amount, not on previously earned interest. For example, $1,000 at 5% for 2 years earns $100 in interest, regardless of whether it's a loan or savings account. The formula works the same for both borrowing and lending scenarios.",

      "faqs": [
        {
          "question": "What's the difference between simple and compound interest?",
          "answer": "Simple interest is calculated only on the original principal amount throughout the entire term. Compound interest is calculated on both the principal and previously earned interest. For example, $1,000 at 10% simple interest for 2 years earns $200 total. The same amount with compound interest earns $210 - the extra $10 comes from interest earned on interest. Simple interest is easier to calculate but compound interest grows money faster."
        },
        {
          "question": "When do people use simple interest?",
          "answer": "Simple interest is used for short-term loans, some personal loans, certain types of bonds, and some savings accounts. It's also used in educational contexts to teach basic interest concepts. Many consumer loans and credit cards use compound interest instead. Simple interest is straightforward and predictable, making it good for understanding the basic mechanics of borrowing and lending before moving to more complex calculations."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I calculate interest for partial years?",
          "answer": "Convert the time period to years for the formula. For months, divide by 12 (6 months = 0.5 years). For days, divide by 365 (or 366 in leap years). For example, $1,000 at 8% for 6 months: Interest = $1,000 × 0.08 × 0.5 = $40. This ensures accurate calculations regardless of the time unit. Most calculators handle this conversion automatically, but understanding the math helps you verify results."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is simple interest better for borrowers or lenders?",
          "answer": "Simple interest is generally better for borrowers because it's easier to understand and calculate. Lenders often prefer compound interest because it generates more interest over time. However, simple interest is more predictable for both parties. Borrowers should understand which type of interest their loans use. For savings, compound interest is usually better for account holders because it grows money faster."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does simple interest affect loan payments?",
          "answer": "With simple interest loans, you pay interest on the original loan amount for the entire loan term. This means your interest costs are fixed and predictable from the start. Unlike amortizing loans, simple interest loans may have equal payments throughout the term, or interest-only payments with a balloon payment at the end. Understanding simple interest helps you compare different loan structures and calculate total borrowing costs."

          "question": "¿Cuál es la diferencia entre interés simple e interés compuesto?",
          "answer": "El interés simple se calcula solo sobre el monto principal original durante todo el término. El interés compuesto se calcula sobre tanto el principal como interés ganado previamente. Por ejemplo, $1,000 al 10% interés simple por 2 años gana $200 total. La misma cantidad con interés compuesto gana $210 - los $10 extra vienen de interés ganado sobre interés. El interés simple es más fácil de calcular pero el interés compuesto hace crecer dinero más rápido."
        },
        {
          "question": "¿Cuándo usan personas interés simple?",
          "answer": "El interés simple se usa para préstamos a corto plazo, algunos préstamos personales, ciertos tipos de bonos, y algunas cuentas de ahorro. También se usa en contextos educativos para enseñar conceptos básicos de interés. Muchos préstamos de consumidor y tarjetas de crédito usan interés compuesto en su lugar. El interés simple es directo y predecible, haciéndolo bueno para entender la mecánica básica de pedir prestado y prestar antes de pasar a cálculos más complejos."
        },
        {
          "question": "¿Cómo calculo interés para años parciales?",
          "answer": "Convierte el período de tiempo a años para la fórmula. Para meses, divide por 12 (6 meses = 0.5 años). Para días, divide por 365 (o 366 en años bisiestos). Por ejemplo, $1,000 al 8% por 6 meses: Interés = $1,000 × 0.08 × 0.5 = $40. Esto asegura cálculos precisos sin importar la unidad de tiempo. La mayoría de calculadoras manejan esta conversión automáticamente, pero entender la matemática te ayuda a verificar resultados."
        },
        {
          "question": "¿Es interés simple mejor para prestatarios o prestamistas?",
          "answer": "El interés simple es generalmente mejor para prestatarios porque es más fácil de entender y calcular. Los prestamistas a menudo prefieren interés compuesto porque genera más interés con el tiempo. Sin embargo, el interés simple es más predecible para ambas partes. Los prestatarios deberían entender qué tipo de interés usan sus préstamos. Para ahorros, el interés compuesto es usualmente mejor para tenedores de cuentas porque hace crecer dinero más rápido."
        },
        {
          "question": "¿Cómo afecta el interés simple a pagos de préstamos?",
          "answer": "Con préstamos de interés simple, pagas interés sobre el monto original del préstamo por todo el término del préstamo. Esto significa que tus costos de interés son fijos y predecibles desde el inicio. A diferencia de préstamos amortizantes, préstamos de interés simple pueden tener pagos iguales durante el término, o pagos solo de interés con un pago globo al final. Entender interés simple te ayuda a comparar diferentes estructuras de préstamo y calcular costos totales de endeudamiento."

Juros compostos são calculados sobre tanto o principal quanto juros ganhos anteriormente. Por exemplo, $1,000 a 10% juros simples por 2 anos ganha $200 total. A mesma quantia com juros compostos ganha $210 - os $10 extras vêm de juros ganhos sobre juros. Juros simples são mais fáceis de calcular mas juros compostos fazem dinheiro crescer mais rápido."

          "question": "Quando pessoas usam juros simples?",
          "answer": "Juros simples são usados para empréstimos de curto prazo, alguns empréstimos pessoais, certos tipos de títulos, e algumas contas de poupança. Também são usados em contextos educacionais para ensinar conceitos básicos de juros. Muitos empréstimos de consumidor e cartões de crédito usam juros compostos ao invés. Juros simples são diretos e previsíveis, tornando-os bons para entender a mecânica básica de emprestar e emprestar antes de passar para cálculos mais complexos."

          "question": "¿Como calculo juros para anos parciais?",
          "answer": "Converta o período de tempo para anos para a fórmula. Para meses, divida por 12 (6 meses = 0.5 anos). Para dias, divida por 365 (ou 366 em anos bissextos). Por exemplo, $1,000 a 8% por 6 meses: Juros = $1,000 × 0.08 × 0.5 = $40. Isso garante cálculos precisos independentemente da unidade de tempo. A maioria das calculadoras lida com esta conversão automaticamente, mas entender a matemática ajuda você a verificar resultados."

          "question": "Juros simples são melhores para tomadores ou emprestadores?",
          "answer": "Juros simples são geralmente melhores para tomadores porque são mais fáceis de entender e calcular. Emprestadores frequentemente preferem juros compostos porque geram mais juros ao longo do tempo. No entanto, juros simples são mais previsíveis para ambas as partes. Tomadores deveriam entender que tipo de juros seus empréstimos usam. Para poupanças, juros compostos são geralmente melhores para detentores de contas porque fazem dinheiro crescer mais rápido."

        {
          "question": "Como juros simples afetam pagamentos de empréstimos?",
          "answer": "Com empréstimos de juros simples, você paga juros sobre o valor original do empréstimo por todo o termo do empréstimo. Isso significa que seus custos de juros são fixos e previsíveis desde o início. Ao contrário de empréstimos amortizantes, empréstimos de juros simples podem ter pagamentos iguais durante o termo, ou pagamentos apenas de juros com um pagamento globo no final. Entender juros simples ajuda você a comparar diferentes estruturas de empréstimo e calcular custos totais de empréstimo."

          "question": "Quelle est la différence entre intérêts simples et intérêts composés ?",
          "answer": "Les intérêts simples sont calculés seulement sur le montant principal original pendant tout le terme. Les intérêts composés sont calculés sur le principal et les intérêts gagnés précédemment. Par exemple, 1 000 $ à 10 % intérêts simples pour 2 ans gagne 200 $ total. Le même montant avec intérêts composés gagne 210 $ - les 10 $ extra viennent d'intérêts gagnés sur intérêts. Intérêts simples sont plus faciles à calculer mais intérêts composés font croître l'argent plus rapidement."

          "question": "Quand les gens utilisent-ils les intérêts simples ?",
          "answer": "Les intérêts simples sont utilisés pour prêts à court terme, certains prêts personnels, certains types d'obligations, et quelques comptes d'épargne. Ils sont aussi utilisés dans contextes éducatifs pour enseigner concepts d'intérêts de base. Beaucoup de prêts de consommation et cartes de crédit utilisent intérêts composés à la place. Intérêts simples sont directs et prévisibles, les rendant bons pour comprendre la mécanique de base d'emprunter et prêter avant de passer à calculs plus complexes."

          "question": "¿Comment calculer les intérêts pour des années partielles ?",
          "answer": "Convertissez la période de temps en années pour la formule. Pour mois, divisez par 12 (6 mois = 0,5 années). Pour jours, divisez par 365 (ou 366 en années bissextiles). Par exemple, 1 000 $ à 8 % pour 6 mois : Intérêts = 1 000 $ × 0,08 × 0,5 = 40 $. Cela assure calculs précis peu importe l'unité de temps. La plupart des calculatrices gèrent cette conversion automatiquement, mais comprendre les maths vous aide à vérifier résultats."

        {
          "question": "Les intérêts simples sont-ils meilleurs pour emprunteurs ou prêteurs ?",
          "answer": "Intérêts simples sont généralement meilleurs pour emprunteurs car ils sont plus faciles à comprendre et calculer. Prêteurs préfèrent souvent intérêts composés car ils génèrent plus d'intérêts au fil du temps. Cependant, intérêts simples sont plus prévisibles pour les deux parties. Emprunteurs devraient comprendre quel type d'intérêts leurs prêts utilisent. Pour épargnes, intérêts composés sont habituellement meilleurs pour détenteurs de comptes car ils font croître l'argent plus rapidement."
        },
        {
          "question": "Comment les intérêts simples affectent-ils les paiements de prêts ?",
          "answer": "Avec prêts d'intérêts simples, vous payez intérêts sur le montant original du prêt pour tout le terme du prêt. Cela signifie que vos coûts d'intérêts sont fixes et prévisibles dès le début. Contrairement à prêts amortissants, prêts d'intérêts simples peuvent avoir paiements égaux pendant le terme, ou paiements d'intérêts seulement avec paiement ballon à la fin. Comprendre intérêts simples vous aide à comparer différentes structures de prêt et calculer coûts totaux d'emprunt."
