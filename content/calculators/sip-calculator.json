    "formulaExplanation": "SIP calculation uses the Future Value formula accounting for regular monthly investments. Your first month's investment gets full compounding time while later investments get progressively less compounding time. The formula considers: FV = P × [((1 + r)^n - 1) / r] × (1 + r), where P is monthly payment, r is monthly return rate, and n is number of months. This ensures each payment compounds at the appropriate rate based on when it's invested.",

      "importantNotes": "SIP returns depend on actual fund performance - past returns are not guaranteed. Stock market volatility may affect short-term returns but benefits from averaging in during downturns. Start SIP early to maximize compound growth (₹500/month at age 25 beats ₹5,000/month at age 35). Review and adjust SIP amount annually based on income growth.",

          "question": "Can I change my SIP amount after starting?",
          "answer": "Yes! Most mutual fund companies allow you to increase SIP amount (Step-up SIP) annually. Some offer flexibility to decrease temporarily during financial hardship. This calculator shows fixed SIP - consult your fund provider for variable SIP options."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is a good expected return rate for SIP calculation?",
          "answer": "Debt funds: 6-8% | Balanced/Hybrid: 10-12% | Equity/Growth: 12-15%. Conservative estimate is 10% for long-term equity SIP. Use higher rates for aggressive portfolios (small-cap funds) and lower for debt-heavy portfolios."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is ₹500/month SIP worth it?",
          "answer": "Absolutely! ₹500/month is perfect starting point. Over 20 years at 12% returns, ₹500 SIP becomes ₹3.84 lakh. Starting is more important than amount. You can increase as income grows."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the difference between SIP and mutual funds?",
          "answer": "Mutual fund is investment product; SIP is method of investing in mutual funds. You can invest lumpsum OR via SIP into same mutual fund. SIP's advantage is disciplined regular investing and rupee-cost averaging."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I withdraw from SIP anytime?",
          "answer": "Yes, but check exit load. Most equity funds have 1% exit load within 1 year. After 1 year, exit is free. Long-term gains (>1 year) get indexation benefits for tax savings in India."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is SIP better than fixed deposits (FDs)?",
          "answer": "For wealth creation over 10+ years, equity SIP historically beats FDs. FDs give ≈6% returns (±2%) while equity SIP averages 12%+ long-term. SIP is better for wealth building; FD is better for capital preservation."
