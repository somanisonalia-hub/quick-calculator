Activity level adds 20-100% more water (athletes and very active people need significantly more). Climate conditions add 10-50% more in hot/dry or humid environments. Health conditions like pregnancy or illness can increase needs by 20-100%. Age and gender have minor effects on total requirements.",
      "examples": [
        "A 70kg moderately active adult in normal climate needs about 2.5 liters (10 cups) of water daily, or about 8 glasses throughout the day",
        "An 80kg very active athlete in hot/dry climate needs about 4 liters (17 cups) of water daily, with special attention to pre/during/post exercise hydration",

Individual needs may vary based on sweat rate, urine color, thirst, medications, caffeine/alcohol intake, and specific health conditions. The calculator provides estimates - monitor your urine color (pale yellow is ideal) and adjust intake based on your body's signals.

          "question": "How much water should I drink per day?",
          "answer": "Daily water needs vary by individual: generally 3.7 liters for men and 2.7 liters for women from all sources (food provides about 20%). Factors like activity level, climate, and health conditions can increase requirements significantly. Use our calculator for personalized recommendations."
        },
        {
          "question": "Does coffee and tea count toward daily water intake?",
          "answer": "Yes, but in moderation. Caffeinated beverages have a mild diuretic effect, so they contribute to hydration but aren't as effective as plain water. Alcohol has a dehydrating effect and doesn't count toward daily water intake. For every caffeinated or alcoholic drink, you may need an extra glass of water."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I know if I'm drinking enough water?",
          "answer": "Monitor urine color - pale yellow or clear indicates good hydration, dark yellow suggests you need more water. Other signs of adequate hydration include regular urination, moist mouth and lips, and absence of thirst. Dehydration signs include dry mouth, fatigue, dizziness, and dark urine."
        },
        {
          "question": "Should I drink more water when exercising?",
          "answer": "Yes, significantly more. Drink 16-32 ounces (475-950ml) of water 2-3 hours before exercise, 6-12 ounces (175-350ml) every 15-20 minutes during exercise, and 16-24 ounces (475-710ml) for every pound (0.45kg) of body weight lost after exercise. In hot weather, increase by 50%."
        },
        {
          "question": "Does drinking more water help with weight loss?",
          "answer": "Water can support weight loss in several ways: it helps control hunger by filling the stomach, boosts metabolism slightly, helps the body burn fat more efficiently, and can replace high-calorie drinks. Drinking water before meals may reduce calorie intake. However, water alone won't cause weight loss without a calorie deficit."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I drink too much water?",
          "answer": "Yes, though rare, overhydration (hyponatremia) can occur, especially during endurance events with excessive water intake without electrolyte replacement. Symptoms include nausea, headache, confusion, and in severe cases, seizures. Stick to recommended amounts and listen to your body's thirst signals."
        },
        {
          "question": "Does food provide water intake?",
          "answer": "Yes, about 20-30% of daily water comes from food. Water-rich foods like fruits and vegetables (cucumbers, watermelon, oranges) contribute significantly. Soups, broths, and foods with high water content help meet daily hydration needs."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does climate affect water needs?",
          "answer": "Hot and dry climates increase water loss through sweat and respiration, requiring 50-100% more water intake. Cold climates can also increase needs due to dry air and indoor heating. Humid climates may require more water for cooling the body. High altitude can increase water needs due to faster breathing."

          "question": "How much water should I drink per day?",
          "answer": "Daily water needs vary by individual: generally 3.7 liters for men and 2.7 liters for women from all sources (food provides about 20%). Factors like activity level, climate, and health conditions can increase requirements significantly. Use our calculator for personalized recommendations."
        },
        {
          "question": "Does coffee and tea count toward daily water intake?",
          "answer": "Yes, but in moderation. Caffeinated beverages have a mild diuretic effect, so they contribute to hydration but aren't as effective as plain water. Alcohol has a dehydrating effect and doesn't count toward daily water intake. For every caffeinated or alcoholic drink, you may need an extra glass of water."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I know if I'm drinking enough water?",
          "answer": "Monitor urine color - pale yellow or clear indicates good hydration, dark yellow suggests you need more water. Other signs of adequate hydration include regular urination, moist mouth and lips, and absence of thirst. Dehydration signs include dry mouth, fatigue, dizziness, and dark urine."
        },
        {
          "question": "Should I drink more water when exercising?",
          "answer": "Yes, significantly more. Drink 16-32 ounces (475-950ml) of water 2-3 hours before exercise, 6-12 ounces (175-350ml) every 15-20 minutes during exercise, and 16-24 ounces (475-710ml) for every pound (0.45kg) of body weight lost after exercise. In hot weather, increase by 50%."
        },
        {
          "question": "Does drinking more water help with weight loss?",
          "answer": "Water can support weight loss in several ways: it helps control hunger by filling the stomach, boosts metabolism slightly, helps the body burn fat more efficiently, and can replace high-calorie drinks. Drinking water before meals may reduce calorie intake. However, water alone won't cause weight loss without a calorie deficit."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I drink too much water?",
          "answer": "Yes, though rare, overhydration (hyponatremia) can occur, especially during endurance events with excessive water intake without electrolyte replacement. Symptoms include nausea, headache, confusion, and in severe cases, seizures. Stick to recommended amounts and listen to your body's thirst signals."
        },
        {
          "question": "Does food provide water intake?",
          "answer": "Yes, about 20-30% of daily water comes from food. Water-rich foods like fruits and vegetables (cucumbers, watermelon, oranges) contribute significantly. Soups, broths, and foods with high water content help meet daily hydration needs."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does climate affect water needs?",
          "answer": "Hot and dry climates increase water loss through sweat and respiration, requiring 50-100% more water intake. Cold climates can also increase needs due to dry air and indoor heating. Humid climates may require more water for cooling the body. High altitude can increase water needs due to faster breathing."

          "answer": "Yes, significantly more. Drink 16-32 ounces (475-950ml) of water 2-3 hours before exercise, 6-12 ounces (175-350ml) every 15-20 minutes during exercise, and 16-24 ounces (475-710ml) for every pound (0.45kg) of body weight lost after exercise. In hot weather, increase by 50%."
        },
        {
          "question": "Does drinking more water help with weight loss?",
          "answer": "Water can support weight loss in several ways: it helps control hunger by filling the stomach, boosts metabolism slightly, helps the body burn fat more efficiently, and can replace high-calorie drinks. Drinking water before meals may reduce calorie intake. However, water alone won't cause weight loss without a calorie deficit."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I drink too much water?",
          "answer": "Yes, though rare, overhydration (hyponatremia) can occur, especially during endurance events with excessive water intake without electrolyte replacement. Symptoms include nausea, headache, confusion, and in severe cases, seizures. Stick to recommended amounts and listen to your body's thirst signals."
        },
        {
          "question": "Does food provide water intake?",
          "answer": "Yes, about 20-30% of daily water comes from food. Water-rich foods like fruits and vegetables (cucumbers, watermelon, oranges) contribute significantly. Soups, broths, and foods with high water content help meet daily hydration needs."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does climate affect water needs?",
          "answer": "Hot and dry climates increase water loss through sweat and respiration, requiring 50-100% more water intake. Cold climates can also increase needs due to dry air and indoor heating. Humid climates may require more water for cooling the body. High altitude can increase water needs due to faster breathing."

Alcohol has a dehydrating effect and doesn't count toward daily water intake. For every caffeinated or alcoholic drink, you may need an extra glass of water."
