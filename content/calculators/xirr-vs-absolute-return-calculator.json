    "summary": "Compare XIRR time-weighted vs absolute return calculations for better investment analysis",
    "introduction": "Different return metrics tell different stories. Absolute return shows your total profit, while XIRR accounts for timing of investments. If you invested ₹50,000, added ₹30,000 six months later, and the portfolio grew to ₹100,000, your absolute return is impressive but XIRR might be different. This calculator shows why understanding both matters.",

    "formulaExplanation": "Absolute Return = [(Final Value - Total Invested) / Total Invested] × 100%. This is simple total profit percentage. XIRR solves NPV = 0 = Σ [Cash Flow / (1 + XIRR)^(days/365)], where each transaction is weighted by duration invested. Example: If you invest ₹100 in year 1 and it becomes ₹110 in year 2, absolute return is 10%. But if you invest ₹100 in year 1, then invest another ₹100 in year 2 (year 2 investment only grows from 100 to 110), XIRR will be lower because half your money only earned 10% while half earned 0% so far.",

        {
          "question": "Why is XIRR better than absolute return?",
          "answer": "Absolute return ignores timing. Someone investing ₹10 lakh 5 years ago vs ₹10 lakh today shouldn't have same return metric. XIRR accounts for this, showing true annualized performance."
        },
        {
          "question": "If I see 60% absolute return, is it good?",
          "answer": "Depends on timeline. 60% over 1 year = excellent (60% XIRR). 60% over 10 years = poor (4.8% XIRR). Always ask: 'How many years?' Absolute return alone is misleading."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can absolute return be higher than XIRR?",
          "answer": "For recent investments yes. If you invested ₹10 lakh 3 months ago and it's ₹11 lakh, absolute = 10%, but XIRR = ~40% annualized. XIRR extrapolates to annual rate."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which metric should I use to compare funds?",
          "answer": "Always use XIRR/CAGR for same time period. Compare funds with same 3-year, 5-year, 10-year XIRR. Absolute return can't be compared across different time periods."
        },
        {
          "question": "How did my 50% absolute return become 15% XIRR?",
          "answer": "Probably invested over longer period (5+ years) with multiple additions. Each addition compounds for different duration. XIRR accounts for this averaging effect."
