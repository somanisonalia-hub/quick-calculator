Weighted calculations give extra points for honors courses, while unweighted treats all courses equally.",

          "question": "What's the difference between a 15-year and 30-year mortgage?",
          "answer": "A 15-year mortgage has higher monthly payments but significantly lower total interest costs and faster equity building. For a $300,000 loan at 6.5% interest, a 30-year term costs about $580 monthly in principal and interest with $279,000 total interest. A 15-year term costs about $2,530 monthly but only $131,000 total interest - saving $148,000 while paying off the loan in half the time."
        },
        {
          "question": "How much can I save by making extra payments?",
          "answer": "Extra payments accelerate equity building and reduce total interest. Making one extra monthly payment per year on a 30-year, $300,000 loan at 6.5% can save approximately $50,000-$70,000 in interest and pay off your loan 5-7 years early. Even $50-$100 extra monthly payments compound significantly over time, especially in early loan years when interest is highest."
